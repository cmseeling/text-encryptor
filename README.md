# text-encryptor

> An electron app for encrypting text files

### Use at your own risk!
I am not a security expert. This application was built to experiment with Electron and to have a better understanding of how the Node crypto package works. There may be security flaws within this program, and I take no responsibiilty if your data gets hacked because you used this application.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```
